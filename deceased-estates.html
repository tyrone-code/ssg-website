    <br>
    <button class="accordion">What is the purpose of a executor?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The executor's function is to wind up the deceased financial affairs, act in the
            fiduciary interest of the
            heirs and to protect their inheritance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-width">&nbsp;</div>
    <button class="accordion">What if the deceased did not leave a will?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>In this case, the Intestate Succession Act provides for the closest family to inherit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-width">&nbsp;</div>
    <button class="accordion">What is the time duration of the administration process?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The administration process is dependant upon the co-operation of government entities, such as the Master of
            the
            High Court, SARS and the Deeds Office. In addition, banks and financial institutions have to provide
            information and it is difficult to calculate an estimated time. A estimate can be provided once we have had
            insight into your particular situation.</p>
