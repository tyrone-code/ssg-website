            <p>SSG Attorneys established in 2003 has served its clients for more than 19 years
                within the jurisdictions of Roodepoort and Randburg. Although we offer a variety of
                legal services the firm is regarded as a boutique law firm as its core business
                offering is in the fiduciary services and in the financial distress/problem solving
                industry. The focus of the firm is predominantly on the following services.

            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="second-paragraph"><strong>Administration of deceased estates : </strong>
            This entails the completion of all the estate reporting documents, obtaining the
            Letters of Executorship or Letters of Authority from the Master of the High
            Court. Thereafter the opening of the estate banking account and the
            publication of the advertisement to creditors in a local newspaper and in the
            Government Gazette. To follow would be the realisation of estate assets or
            the transfer of the assets in its existing form to the heirs whereafter the
            preparation of the Liquidation &amp; Distribution account can be commenced with,
            for approval by the Master of the High Court. Additional matters entail the
            transfer of immovable property, vehicles and firearms to heirs or purchasers
            together with the finalization of tax matters.</p>

        <p class="third-paragraph"><strong>The administration of insolvent deceased (section 34) estates:</strong>
            This procedure entails the same administration procedure as above but differs
            in certain aspects as all assets must be sold, the Insolvency Act applies in
            addition to the Administration of Estates Act and the Liquidation &amp; Distribution
            account will reflect secured, preferent and concurrent dividends to creditors.
            Specific legal circumstances apply to the surviving spouse who was married
            in community of property to the deceased who we assist not to accept liability
            for the debts of the joint insolvent deceased estate. Section 34 of the
            Administration of Estates Act requires that the Liquidation &amp; Distribution
            account must be confirmed by the Master of the High Court.</p>

        <p class="fourth-paragraph">
            <strong>Estate planning &amp; wills:</strong> Estate planning entails the anticipation of costs and taxes
            later and the
            institution of measures to meet these costs and/or to reduce/avoid taxes
            where possible. We recommend that wills be drafted in a simplistic manner
            and that complex issues be avoided where possible. We are prepared to draft
            wills at no cost subject to terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="fourth-paragraph1">
            <strong>Liquidation, sequestration &amp; rehabilitation:</strong>
            Liquidations refer to companies and juristic entities while sequestration refers
            to individuals. Liquidators are appointed in juristic entities and Trustees in
            sequestrations of individuals. We attend to creditors voluntary winding up at

            CIPC or liquidation applications to the High Court. With regards to individuals,
            we attend to compulsory or voluntary surrender high court applications. In
            addition, we attend to rehabilitation applications and assist insolvents to
            obtain credit even prior to rehabilitation.
        </p>

        <p class="fourth-paragraph2">
            <strong>Negotiations with creditors to reach amicable settlements to debt problems:</strong>
            We negotiate with banks, landlords and any other creditors to reach
            settlements in respect of any debt. These settlements may be on an agreed
            monthly payment basis or on a once-off full and final settlement basis. Our
            once-off full and final settlement offers are often motivated by providing the
            creditor with a calculation of an anticipated dividend in the event of
            liquidation/sequestration, as compared to the settlement offer.
        </p>
        <p class="fourth-paragraph3">
            <strong>Applications for the appointment of Curators or Administrators in terms of the
                Mental Health Care Act:</strong> We attend to applications to the High Court or the Master of the High
            Court in
            matters where, for example Alzheimerâ€™s or dementia has resulted in an
            inability to legally and validly contract or a general power of attorney has
            expired. We also prepare an enduring power of attorney to enable the family
            of a prospective mental patient to save the costs of these applications.
        </p>
